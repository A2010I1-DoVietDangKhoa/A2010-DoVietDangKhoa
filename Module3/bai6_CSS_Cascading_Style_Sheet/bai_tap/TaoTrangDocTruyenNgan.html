       Tests on the cup revealed that the cup is evenly made up the elements that make up wood, stainless steel, and ceramic.

        Date: 12/03/2021<br>
        Total Items: Three cans of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray<br><br>

        Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray<br>
        Setting: 1:1<br>
        Output: One can of Off! brand spider repellant spray. This is not an existing product from the manufacturer.<br><br>

        Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray<br>
        Setting: Fine<br>
        Output: An animate bat made of metal, with an insect spray contained inside its abdomen.
       The bat is typically passive, but if it detects a mosquito it will chase after and spray it, using a sprayer on the inside of its mouth.<br><br>

        Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray<br>
        Setting: Very Fine<br>
        Output: One can of On! brand mosquito attractant spray<br><br>

        Incident Report: After all those overseeing the test were given protective clothing,
       D-017472 was instructed to spray himself with the output. Shortly after doing so,
       masses of mosquitoes began to swarm into the facility and clustered around D-017472, who died from blood loss within thirty seconds.
       After the D-Class expired, the mosquitoes began attempting to attack other personnel in the facility.
       Mosquitoes were eventually terminated via H2O-9000, the on-site sprinkler system, the Fine output produced prior to this one,
       and chemical bug spray, and a cleanup crew has been assigned to remove the dead insects and perform a thorough cleansing of the facility.
       Though several personnel have developed rashes due to mosquito bites, the only casualty was the assigned D-Class.
       All people on-site will be screened for malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.<br><br>

        Note: You know what? This is it. This is the single most horrifying thing that I have experienced at this facility.
       Not the 8-ball spider thing. Not the fact that I was put in a coma for three days.
       Not that I witnessed as all the water was violently siphoned out of a D-class's body,
       turning him into a shriveled-up raisin. No, this is what's going to make my skin crawl for months.
       I overheard someone saying that there were mosquitoes pouring out of the drains in the sinks.
       And that D-Class… I could hear him scream, and then the screaming became drowned out as his mouth was filled with mosquitoes.
       I am so stupid. Why did I even for a single second think that it would be a good idea to test this output?
       It's literally what it said on the tin. Fucking mosquito attractant. It attracts mosquitoes.
       Didn't need a fucking rocket scientist to figure that one out. Nice going, Boneka.
       I think I'm going to have nightmares about this. - JR Boneka<br><br>

        Note: JR. Boneka has been scheduled for psychiatric evaluation at my request.
       Amnestic treatment is currently being considered has been performed by on-site psychiatrist Dr. Serrano and myself.
       JR Boneka has been informed about the reason behind this decision,
       but security recordings have been destroyed for the well-being of herself and other personnel. - Veritas<br><br></p>

       Total Items: 5 stepped caps lock keycaps, 5 plain caps lock keycaps<br><br>

       Input: One stepped caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Rough<br>
       Output: Shredded plastic<br><br>

       Input: One stepped caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Coarse<br>
       Output: One plain caps lock keycap<br><br>

       Input: One stepped caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: 1:1<br>
       Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Hats Lock".
       Using it on a keyboard produces no anomalous effect.<br><br>

       Input: One stepped caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Fine<br>
       Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Cap Lock".
       Using it on a keyboard in place of the caps lock key prevents all other keycaps from detaching.<br><br>

       Input: One stepped caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Very Fine<br>
       Output: A small plastic pill.<br><br>

       Note: Object has been transported to another site for safe testing. - Belopaku<br><br>

       Input: One plain caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Rough<br>
       Output: A thin irregular disk of plastic that appears to be a solidified puddle of molten plastic.<br><br>

       Input: One plain caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Coarse<br>
       Output: One menu key keycap<br><br>

       Input: One plain caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: 1:1<br>
       Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Cups Lock".
       Using it on a keyboard produces no anomalous effect.<br><br>

       Input: One plain caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Fine<br>
       Output: A similar-sized keycap with the words "Caps Lock Undo" printed on the top.
       Closer inspection has revealed that it may cause some anomalous effect when used on a keyboard,
       but it appears to be unable to fit in any known make of keyboard.<br><br>

       Input: One plain caps lock keycap<br>
       Setting: Very Fine<br>
       Output: A thin plastic film, with the words "Locks Cap" printed on its surface.
       Upon touching the surface of any lock(the definition of "lock" appears to be arbitrary but reasonable),
       it will wrap itself around it, turning itself into a removable 'cap' for the lock.
       The object returns to its film state once removed.<br><br></p>
